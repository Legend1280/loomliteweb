# Loom Lite Project TODO

## Design & Theme
- [x] Setup yellow/black/gray/white color scheme
- [x] Configure dark theme with yellow accents
- [x] Add Google Fonts for typography

## Content Sections
- [x] Hero section with headline and CTAs
- [x] Problem section (90% unstructured data)
- [x] Solution section with animated graph
- [x] For Humans/For Machines comparison table
- [x] Enterprise Integration section
- [x] Philosophy section
- [x] Final CTA section
- [x] Footer

## Visual Effects
- [x] Yellow glow effect on text elements
- [x] Yellow glow effect around placeholder images
- [x] Black placeholder images for UI screenshots
- [x] Smooth scroll animations
- [x] Fade-in animations on scroll
- [x] Animated graph/diagram elements

## Icons & Assets
- [x] Add lucide-react icons throughout
- [x] Create placeholder image components with glow

## Responsive Design
- [x] Mobile-first responsive layout
- [x] Tablet breakpoints
- [x] Desktop optimization



## Design Refinements
- [x] Reduce font weights for more minimal look
- [x] Increase negative space and spacing between sections
- [x] Lighter font weights for headings
- [x] More breathing room in layout



## Animated Fabric Background
- [x] Create 3D geometric mesh/fabric background
- [x] Implement wave animation that undulates across the canvas
- [x] Add visibility threshold (parts below "water line" disappear)
- [x] Apply yellow/gray color scheme to mesh
- [x] Ensure it stays in backdrop (behind content)
- [x] Make it subtle and fade in/out organically



## Bug Fixes
- [x] Increase visibility of fabric background effect (currently too subtle/invisible)



## Geometric Fabric Redesign
- [x] Create visible geometric fabric with nodes and connecting lines
- [x] Make nodes yellow colored and clearly visible
- [x] Add flowing animation to the fabric
- [x] Ensure it's apparent in the background



## Fabric Redesign - Organic Network
- [x] Replace grid with randomly positioned nodes
- [x] Create triangulated connections between nodes (Delaunay-style)
- [x] Vary node sizes (some larger, some smaller)
- [x] Make connections form triangular/irregular patterns
- [x] Keep yellow color scheme with subtle animation



## Fabric Flow Redesign
- [x] Change fabric to flow diagonally across page (like crossing a road)
- [x] Place fabric only in select areas/negative space
- [x] Use fabric to connect sections as visual bridges
- [x] Remove full-background coverage
- [x] Create 2-3 diagonal fabric streams that appear between content sections



## Bugs
- [x] Fabric streams not visible - debug and fix rendering issue



## Fabric Positioning Refinement
- [x] Reduce to only 2 fabric streams
- [x] Position streams in identified negative space areas
- [x] Move first stream 30% down and to bottom-right of initial viewport
- [x] Make streams off-center and less intrusive
- [x] Ensure streams flow off the page edges
- [x] Increase node count for longer, more visible streams



## Fabric Lattice Enhancement
- [x] Add more branching connections between nodes
- [x] Create lattice/woven fabric pattern with dense interconnections
- [x] Each node should connect to multiple nearby nodes (not just adjacent)
- [x] Maintain diagonal flow across screen



## Content Updates
- [x] Update glow highlights to only "structure" and "everything" in hero
- [x] Update demo link to https://loomlite.vercel.app
- [x] Add email link to brady@moped.com



## Button Styling
- [x] Make buttons more elegant and minimal
- [x] Reduce border thickness and padding
- [x] Use lighter font weights
- [x] Subtle hover effects
